# Tazer Ragdoll
The tazer now just does a little bit damage... Little bit useless right?  
That's what I thought, so I made a script that makes the player lay on the ground for 6 seconds.  
You can change how many seconds the player needs to be on the ground in [tazer.lua](https://github.com/FinnCoding/OnsetRagdoll/blob/master/tazer.lua).
